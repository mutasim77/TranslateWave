# TranslateWave 🌍

Welcome! 🥰

I've recently come across a fantastic and free <a href="https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php">API</a> for translation (it does have a character limit, but that's not a problem). This discovery prompted me to develop a website using React and TypeScript ✨. To enhance the visual appeal, I've incorporated Chakra UI 💎 for styling. The best part? The website is already deployed 🛠️. Feel free to check it out through the following 
 <a href="https://famous-kheer-b6de53.netlify.app/">link</a>. Thank you for taking the time to explore it. If you find it intriguing, consider giving the repository a star 🌟. 
 
 Have a wonderful day! 🚀
